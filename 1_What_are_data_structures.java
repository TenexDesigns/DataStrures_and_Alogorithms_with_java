Data Structures
  - It is a way to organise data
  - After organizing data it becomes easy to process it.

  e.g seaarching for a book in an unorganised librly vs searching for a book in an organised librly


  Types of Data Strures
  
  Linear - Data is arrengr sequentily one after the other
    - array
    - Linked list
    - Stack
    - Queue

  Non-Linear - data is not arranged sequentially
    - Tree 
    - graph


  Data structures can be broadly categorized into two main categories: linear data structures and non-linear data structures. Each category has its own characteristics, use cases, advantages, and disadvantages. Let's explore these categories, provide examples, and discuss their pros, cons, and differences:

**Linear Data Structures:**

1. **Arrays:**
   - **Examples:** One-dimensional arrays, multidimensional arrays.
   - **Pros:** Fast access by index, simple to implement, memory-efficient.
   - **Cons:** Fixed size (usually), inefficient insertions and deletions in the middle.

2. **Linked Lists:**
   - **Examples:** Singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, circular linked lists.
   - **Pros:** Dynamic size, efficient insertions and deletions, no wasted memory.
   - **Cons:** Slower random access, extra memory overhead for storing links.

3. **Stacks:**
   - **Examples:** The call stack in programming, stack data structure.
   - **Pros:** LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) behavior, simple and efficient for managing function calls and certain algorithms.
   - **Cons:** Limited in functionality compared to other data structures.

4. **Queues:**
   - **Examples:** Linear queues, circular queues, priority queues.
   - **Pros:** FIFO (First-In-First-Out) behavior, useful for tasks like task scheduling and managing resources.
   - **Cons:** Limited in functionality for certain tasks, such as complex data manipulation.

**Non-Linear Data Structures:**

1. **Trees:**
   - **Examples:** Binary trees, AVL trees, B-trees.
   - **Pros:** Hierarchical structure, efficient searching, sorting, and insertion.
   - **Cons:** Complex to implement, may become unbalanced.

2. **Graphs:**
   - **Examples:** Directed graphs, undirected graphs, weighted graphs.
   - **Pros:** Modeling complex relationships, various traversal algorithms available.
   - **Cons:** Complex to implement and analyze, potential for cycles and infinite loops.

3. **Hash Tables:**
   - **Examples:** HashMap in Java, dictionaries in Python.
   - **Pros:** Fast key-value pair lookup, constant-time average-case complexity for insertion and retrieval.
   - **Cons:** Limited ordering, potential collisions, memory overhead.

**Differences:**

1. **Linear vs. Non-Linear:** Linear data structures organize data sequentially, while non-linear data structures allow for more complex relationships and hierarchies.

2. **Access Patterns:** Linear data structures are well-suited for linear access patterns (e.g., arrays for indexing), while non-linear structures are better for modeling relationships (e.g., trees and graphs).

3. **Insertions/Deletions:** Linear structures like linked lists excel at insertions and deletions, while non-linear structures like trees and graphs may require more complex operations.

4. **Use Cases:** Linear data structures are often used for tasks like indexing, queues, and stacks. Non-linear structures are used for modeling hierarchical relationships, complex networks, and associative data.

5. **Complexity:** Non-linear structures are generally more complex to implement and analyze compared to linear structures.

Choosing the right data structure depends on the specific requirements of your problem. Linear structures are often used when you need simple access patterns, while non-linear structures are employed for more intricate data relationships. Careful consideration of pros, cons, and differences is essential to make informed choices when designing algorithms and data storage in software development.





DEFINITION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  Data structures are fundamental constructs in computer science and programming that allow you to organize, store, and manipulate data efficiently. They provide a way to represent and manage collections of data and are a critical component of algorithm design and optimization. Data structures define how data is stored and accessed in a computer program, and they can significantly impact the performance and efficiency of algorithms.

Here are some key aspects and types of data structures:

1. **Storage and Organization:** Data structures determine how data is stored in memory and how it can be accessed or modified.

2. **Efficiency:** Data structures are designed to perform specific operations efficiently. The choice of data structure depends on the operations you need to perform frequently.

3. **Abstraction:** Data structures often provide a level of abstraction, allowing programmers to work with data at a high level without needing to understand the low-level details of memory management.

4. **Common Data Structures:**
   - **Arrays:** A basic data structure that stores elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations.
   - **Lists:** A collection of elements that may or may not be stored in contiguous memory. Lists can be implemented using arrays or linked structures.
   - **Stacks:** A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure that allows elements to be pushed onto and popped off the top of the stack.
   - **Queues:** A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure used for managing elements in a linear order.
   - **Trees:** Hierarchical data structures with nodes that have parent-child relationships, such as binary trees, AVL trees, and B-trees.
   - **Graphs:** Structures consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect nodes. Graphs can be directed or undirected.
   - **Hash Tables:** Data structures that allow efficient key-value pair storage and retrieval.
   - **Heaps:** Specialized tree-based structures used to maintain the maximum or minimum element efficiently.
   - **Linked Structures:** Data structures like linked lists, where each element points to the next, allowing for efficient insertions and deletions.

5. **Complexity Analysis:** Data structures are analyzed in terms of time and space complexity to understand their performance characteristics.

6. **Choice of Data Structure:** Selecting the right data structure is crucial in software development. The choice depends on the problem's requirements, such as the type of data, the operations to be performed, and the expected time and space constraints.

7. **Algorithms:** Algorithms are sets of instructions for performing specific tasks or operations on data structures. Effective algorithms are designed with the underlying data structure in mind to achieve the desired efficiency.

In summary, data structures are essential tools for organizing and managing data in computer programs. Choosing the appropriate data structure for a given problem and implementing efficient algorithms to manipulate that data structure are fundamental skills for software developers and computer scientists.
