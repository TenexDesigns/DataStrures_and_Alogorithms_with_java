Yes, the information provided above should help you with implementing the `removeDuplicates` method in your singly linked list.

Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing the `removeDuplicates` method using the provided approach:

1. Create a `HashSet` to store the unique elements encountered while traversing the linked list.
2. Initialize two pointers, `previous` and `current`, to keep track of the nodes during traversal.
3. Start traversing the linked list from the head node.
4. For each node, check if its data is already present in the `HashSet`.
5. If the data is not present, add it to the `HashSet` and move the `previous` pointer to the current node.
6. If the data is already present, skip the current node by adjusting the `next` pointer of the `previous` node.
7. Continue the traversal until the end of the list is reached.

Here's an example implementation:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

public class SinglyLinkedList {
    private Node head;

    // ...

    public void removeDuplicates() {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) {
            return;
        }

        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        Node previous = null;
        Node current = head;

        while (current != null) {
            int data = current.data;

            if (set.contains(data)) {
                previous.next = current.next;
            } else {
                set.add(data);
                previous = current;
            }

            current = current.next;
        }
    }
}
```

You can now use the `removeDuplicates` method in your `SinglyLinkedList` class to remove duplicates from the linked list.

Example usage:

```java
SinglyLinkedList list = new SinglyLinkedList();
// Populate the list with nodes

System.out.println("Original list:");
list.printLinkedList();

list.removeDuplicates();

System.out.println("List after removing duplicates:");
list.printLinkedList();
```

Make sure to replace `Node` with the actual name of your node class and `printLinkedList` with a method that prints the content of the linked list.

This implementation uses a `HashSet` to keep track of the unique elements encountered while traversing the linked list. It has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, and a space complexity of O(n) to store the unique elements in the `HashSet`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

  To remove duplicates from a singly linked list in Java, you can use the following approach:

1. Create a `HashSet` to store the unique elements encountered while traversing the linked list.
2. Initialize two pointers, `previous` and `current`, to keep track of the nodes during traversal.
3. Start traversing the linked list from the head node.
4. For each node, check if its data is already present in the `HashSet`.
5. If the data is not present, add it to the `HashSet` and move the `previous` pointer to the current node.
6. If the data is already present, skip the current node by adjusting the `next` pointer of the `previous` node.
7. Continue the traversal until the end of the list is reached.

Here's an example implementation:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

public class SinglyLinkedList {
    private Node head;

    // ...

    public void removeDuplicates() {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) {
            return;
        }

        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        Node previous = null;
        Node current = head;

        while (current != null) {
            int data = current.data;

            if (set.contains(data)) {
                previous.next = current.next;
            } else {
                set.add(data);
                previous = current;
            }

            current = current.next;
        }
    }
}
```

You can use the `removeDuplicates` method in your `SinglyLinkedList` class to remove duplicates from the linked list. Here's an example usage:

```java
SinglyLinkedList list = new SinglyLinkedList();
list.insertFirst(1);
list.insertFirst(2);
list.insertFirst(2);
list.insertFirst(3);
list.insertFirst(4);
list.insertFirst(4);
list.printLinkedList();  // Output: 4 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 2 -> 1

list.removeDuplicates();
list.printLinkedList();  // Output: 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
```

This implementation uses a HashSet to keep track of the unique elements encountered while traversing the linked list. It has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, and a space complexity of O(n) to store the unique elements in the HashSet.
