From the given search results, I found some beginner-level LeetCode problems related to linked lists along with their solutions. Here are a few examples:

1. Reverse Linked List:
   - Problem: Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.
   - [Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/solution/): You can reverse the linked list iteratively by maintaining three pointers: `previous`, `current`, and `next`. Iterate through the list, update the `next` pointer of each node to point to its previous node, and move the pointers forward. Finally, update the `head` pointer to the last node encountered.

2. Linked List Cycle:
   - Problem: Given the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
   - [Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/solution/): You can use the "two pointers" technique to detect a cycle in a linked list. Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both pointing to the head. Move `slow` one step at a time and `fast` two steps at a time. If there is a cycle, the `fast` pointer will eventually catch up to the `slow` pointer. If the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list (i.e., becomes `null`), there is no cycle.

3. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List:
   - Problem: Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers.
   - [Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/solution/): Iterate through the list and compare each node's value with its next node's value. If they are equal, update the next pointer of the current node to skip the next duplicate node. If they are not equal, move the current pointer to the next node. Repeat this process until the end of the list is reached.

4. Merge k Sorted Lists:
   - Problem: You are given an array of "k" linked lists, with each linked list sorted in ascending order. Merge all the linked lists into one sorted linked list and return it.
   - [Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/solution/): Use a min-heap (priority queue) to keep track of the smallest node among the heads of all linked lists. Initialize the min-heap with the heads of all linked lists. While the min-heap is not empty, remove the smallest node from the min-heap and add it to the merged list. If the removed node has a next node, add the next node to the min-heap. Repeat this process until the min-heap is empty.

These are just a few examples of beginner-level LeetCode problems related to linked lists. You can find more problems and their solutions on the LeetCode platform. It's a great resource for practicing algorithms and data structures.
