The problem "Remove Duplicates from Sorted List" on LeetCode asks us to remove duplicates from a sorted linked list. We need to delete all duplicate nodes so that each element appears only once in the list. The resulting list should also be sorted.

Here is a step-by-step solution to solve this problem:

1. Check if the given linked list is empty or has only one node. If so, there are no duplicates to remove, so return the list as it is.
2. Initialize two pointers, `prev` and `curr`, both pointing to the head of the linked list.
3. Iterate through the list using the `curr` pointer:
   - If the value of the current node (`curr->val`) is equal to the value of the next node (`curr->next->val`), it means there is a duplicate. Move the `curr` pointer to the next node (`curr = curr->next`) to skip the duplicate node.
   - If the values are not equal, update the `next` pointer of the `prev` node to point to the current node (`prev->next = curr`), and move both the `prev` and `curr` pointers to their next nodes (`prev = curr` and `curr = curr->next`).
4. After the loop ends, set the `next` pointer of the last non-duplicate node to `NULL` to mark the end of the list (`prev->next = NULL`).
5. Return the modified linked list, starting from the head.

Here's the code implementation in C++:

```cpp
ListNode* deleteDuplicates(ListNode* head) {
    if (head == nullptr || head->next == nullptr) {
        return head;
    }
    
    ListNode* prev = head;
    ListNode* curr = head->next;
    
    while (curr != nullptr) {
        if (prev->val == curr->val) {
            curr = curr->next;
        } else {
            prev->next = curr;
            prev = curr;
            curr = curr->next;
        }
    }
    
    prev->next = nullptr;
    return head;
}
```

This code iterates through the linked list once, comparing the values of adjacent nodes to identify duplicates. It updates the `next` pointers accordingly to remove duplicates and maintain the order of the remaining nodes.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. The space complexity is O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
