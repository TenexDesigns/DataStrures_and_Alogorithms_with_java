The problem "Linked List Cycle" on LeetCode asks us to determine whether a given linked list contains a cycle. We can solve this problem using the concept of two pointers: a slow pointer that moves one step at a time and a fast pointer that moves two steps at a time. If a cycle exists in the linked list, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer. If there is no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the list.

Here is a step-by-step solution to solve this problem:

1. Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both pointing to the head of the linked list.
2. While the `fast` pointer and its next node are not `null`, do the following:
   - Move the `slow` pointer one step forward by setting it to its next node.
   - Move the `fast` pointer two steps forward by setting it to its next node's next node.
   - Check if the `slow` pointer is equal to the `fast` pointer. If they are equal, it means a cycle exists in the linked list, so return `true`.
3. If the loop exits, it means there is no cycle in the linked list, so return `false`.

Here's the code implementation in C++:

```cpp
bool hasCycle(ListNode* head) {
    if (head == nullptr) {
        return false;
    }
    ListNode* slow = head;
    ListNode* fast = head->next;
    while (slow != fast) {
        if (fast == nullptr || fast->next == nullptr) {
            return false;
        }
        slow = slow->next;
        fast = fast->next->next;
    }
    return true;
}
```

This code uses the Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm to determine the presence of a cycle in the linked list.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. The space complexity is O(1), as we are using only two pointers to detect the cycle.

**Approach:**
To solve this problem, we can use the concept of two pointers: a slow pointer and a fast pointer. The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. If there is a cycle in the linked list, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer. If there is no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the list.

Here's the step-by-step solution in C#:

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public bool HasCycle(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null) {
            return false;
        }
        
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;
        
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
            
            if (slow == fast) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
}
```

This solution uses the Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm. It initializes two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both pointing to the head of the linked list. The `slow` pointer moves one step at a time, while the `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time. If there is a cycle, the `fast` pointer will eventually catch up to the `slow` pointer. If there is no cycle, the `fast` pointer will reach the end of the list.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. The space complexity is O(1) since we only use two pointers.
