Certainly! Here are a few simple beginner-level LeetCode problems related to linked lists along with their solutions in Java:

**Problem 1: Reverse Linked List (Easy)**

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list and return its head.

**Solution:**
```java
public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
    ListNode prev = null;
    ListNode current = head;
    
    while (current != null) {
        ListNode next = current.next;
        current.next = prev;
        prev = current;
        current = next;
    }
    
    return prev;
}
```

**Problem 2: Middle of the Linked List (Easy)**

Given the head of a singly linked list, find the middle node. If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

**Solution:**
```java
public ListNode middleNode(ListNode head) {
    ListNode slow = head;
    ListNode fast = head;
    
    while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
    }
    
    return slow;
}
```

**Problem 3: Delete Node in a Linked List (Easy)**

Write a function to delete a node in a singly linked list. You will not be given access to the head of the list, but instead, you will be given access to the node to be deleted.

**Solution:**
```java
public void deleteNode(ListNode node) {
    if (node == null || node.next == null) {
        return;
    }
    
    node.val = node.next.val;
    node.next = node.next.next;
}
```

**Problem 4: Merge Two Sorted Lists (Easy)**

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The resulting list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the two lists.

**Solution:**
```java
public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
    ListNode dummy = new ListNode(-1);
    ListNode current = dummy;
    
    while (l1 != null && l2 != null) {
        if (l1.val <= l2.val) {
            current.next = l1;
            l1 = l1.next;
        } else {
            current.next = l2;
            l2 = l2.next;
        }
        current = current.next;
    }
    
    current.next = (l1 != null) ? l1 : l2;
    
    return dummy.next;
}
```

These problems are excellent starting points for practicing linked list operations and building your problem-solving skills on LeetCode. They cover some fundamental concepts
  related to singly linked lists and should be approachable for beginners.
